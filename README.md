### Hello!! ðŸ˜„

- I'm Daiane and currently working from home in Ohio (USA) for Getulio Vargas Foundation in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil).
- I'm a Statistician
- I'm working on projects with focus on data analysis, time series forecasting, and data visualization.
- I used to be a teacher while I was in Brazil. That was something that brought me lots of joy. Maybe, someday, I will teach in the USA.
